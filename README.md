# dialogflow-wolfram-fulfillment


This is a small nodeJS application to help you connect Dialogflow and Wolfram|Alpha

Since I could not manage to find something similar, I thought this might be of help to somebody.
I needed a Fulfillment for Dialogflow that is able to communicate with the Wolfram|Alpha API. So this is what I built.

### Coming soon
Currently I am working on an integration for the Wolfram|Alpha Conversational API. This and a tutorial on how to use everything (for unexperienced developers) is going to come soon!
